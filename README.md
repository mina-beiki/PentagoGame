# PentagoGame
My advanced programming second main project (concluded in "Nowrooz" projects ) . Pentago is a game played by 2 players which is implemented in 2 modes :
multi player and with computer player . 

This game is based on the popular classic game called "Pentago" . It is easy to play with since it has no complicated graphics . 

Instructions : 
STARTING/ The game starts with an empty game board, consisting of the base and the four twistable game blocks.  Decide marble color of each player. To determine who  goes  first,  disguise  one  of  each  color  marble  in  your  hands  and  have  your opponent  choose  one  hand.    The  chosen  color  goes  first  and  places  a  marble anywhere on the game board.

OBJECT/ The object is to get five marbles in a row before your opponent does.  The mind twisting part of Pentago is that each player will also twist one of the four game blocks 90 degrees (one “notch”), clockwise or counter clockwise, as part of each turn. A 180 degree (double “notch”) twist is not allowed.  The twist is the key to create winning positions in Pentago.PLAYING/ Players take turns at placing marbles on the game board and twisting the game blocks.  A player is free to twist any of the game blocks, regardless of which game block the player placed the marble on.  In the beginning of the game, there will be neutral game blocks, allowing a player to ignore the twist portion of their turn. A neutral game block is one that is empty or has only one marble in the middle  of  it.    Twisting  a  neutral  game  block  will  have  no  effect  on  the  positional nature of the game board so the twisting part of a move is optional while there are neutral game blocks. 

WINNING/ A  winning  row  of  five  marbles  can  occur  vertically,  horizontally  or diagonally, anywhere on the board and will span two or three game blocks. What seems like a simple five-in-a-row game quickly gets mind twisting as the board fills up and both players are twisting the game blocks, creating a constantly changing and challenging game scenario. You’ll want to really watch your opponents position as it relates to yours and play as much defensive as you do offense.
